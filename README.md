## üß† Inspiration

The idea for Pill Pal emerged when a team member shared a personal story about their parents, who struggle with taking medications on time.  
Managing medication schedules manually is time-consuming and overwhelming, especially for older adults.  
There was also a lack of a supportive community for people facing similar challenges.  

This sparked the idea to create an app that not only helps users manage their medication but also connects them to a supportive community.
